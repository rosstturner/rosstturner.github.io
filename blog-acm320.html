                                    Started to block out the rest of my animation. I have decided to use a bunch of cuts between the robots main movements so that
                                    I can use more time on the actions since I am already approaching the one minute mark. I still have a good bit of work to do
                                    but it is coming along. The longest part I still have left is just rendering the whole thing twice so that I can mess with the
                                    special effects in After Effects and attempt to figure out how to do the color swipe.

                                I have pretty much finished the first part of my animation. I have a little tweaking to do and I have also decided to add a camera
                                zoom to the radio so you can see what is happening a little better. I also want to add just a bit more digital face tweaks but they 
                                tend to eat up a lot of time and I am not sure if it is worth the trouble. I am really liking the way it all looks even though I am
                                having doubts about the storyline working out how I wanted. My goal is to just get the animating done and then see what tweaks I can 
                                make it feel just a little bit more like a story. I have about 30 seconds completed so far.

                                    Back to Animating. I am currently working on just getting everything where I need to go. I have run into an issue with the
                                    digital face again though and because of this, I think I am going to actually create my animation in two separate parts and
                                    just combine them in post. So I will focus on part 1 of my animation this week and next. Part 2 is actually faster and has less
                                    technical features and should go smoothly. I am still leaning towards adding comic like effects in post as I think it will just
                                    reinforce the toon shaders.

                                    Spring break was last week and I truly just needed a break. Because of this break, I fell behind a bit in the
                                    internship that I work. I had to dedicate this week to making up those hours and because of that, my animation
                                    will be behind my production schedule by about a week. Thankfully, I took the majority of my earlier work time to get out
                                    a lot of the tecnhincal kinks that I would normally be dealing with after animating. Hopefully this speeds up my
                                    production schedule after I animate and get me back on track.

                                While I admit that I did not get as far as I wanted, I am still about a week and a half ahead of my schedule. I think
                                that I am making really great progress and I have finally worked out all the kinks that have been tied to the complicated
                                render process that I am using. From here on I can focus on the animation portion of my schedule and then come back to the render/
                                lighting afterwards. My character's face still needs some tweaks, but those will be addressed as I animate them because I am sure that
                                I will want change it as I start to actually pull things together. The second camera is really working out well and I did not
                                get a change to show it in the animatic but the tweaks of the camera lens/convex feel is dialed in just how I want it now.

                                <h3> Second Camera</h3>
                                    I took the advice of my professor and thought about how to add a second camera. Since the room is so small, I had a hard time trying to figure
                                    a different way to show the room and also how it would change/drive the story. I decided to add a small security camera that would add to the
                                    feeling that we are watching the main computer through the eyes of more technology. It took me a while to get the look how I wanted. I discovered
                                    that hidden within the Arnold settings of the camera, you can change the rotation to give it a convex look like a camera lens can do. I then took
                                    this image and edited it further in Photoshop but will add all the effects to the final render in After Effects. I really like the look and feel
                                    of the security camera and I think that it will be very useful to have another angle that I can then use to zoom in on the hand of my character
                                    when he is first discovering the color change effect.

                                    During the week, I took a break from modeling since I was already making really good progress. I have also
                                    decided that I will not require any form of rigging for my main character and instead I can focus on the
                                    mechanics of his digital screen face. It was a little tricky, but I was able to figure out how to tie down
                                    the MASH network to a mesh so that it will follow my character around when he moves. This was one of my bigger
                                    concerns when I decided to go the MASH network route. I also have been trying to find better ways to tweak the
                                    renderer to make it a little lighter when it comes to checking my work. I started to play with render layers
                                    like I have in the past and I think that I will spend some time investigating this further to see it will work
                                    with the toon shader that I have created. Finally, I don't want to forget about sound, so I started to look into
                                    free sound effects. I know that there is a database offered by the school for sounds but then I also discovered that
                                    there are thousands of sounds at my disposal through Adobe Creative Cloud since I am also paying for it for school.

                                    I finally finished my main character. I also was able to wrap up all of my assets including the back ground city scape
                                    that I was the most worried about. The city could still use some work but I think that it is okay to start animating and adding
                                    more detail to the textures. I have continued to run test renders to see how things are coming together and I have really liked
                                    the results so far. My script is finalized and I have completely filled out the pre-production package for class. From here on,
                                    I will be following the schedule that I layed out and I should be able to finsish with some time to spare. My package is estimating
                                    about 23 days of animation but I think that it will be much faster due to the fact that I have only a few different textures to create
                                    and the rigging is almost non-existant. I will be starting animations very soon and will post the test to here.

                                    I have been working on my character model again. I have been struggling with
                                    getting the right look for the main robot. I think that I am close to it with
                                    my current version, so I have decided to move on for now and maybe it will look
                                    more correct when I finish my initial scenes. I have started building out all the
                                    rest of my models. They do not have a lot of detail so making them should be fairly
                                    quick. I also fully filled out my pre-production document and have a good schedule to
                                    follow. My schedule is estimating 23 days of animations but I think that I will be able
                                    to speed up several areas of the pipeline because so many items are simply designed and
                                    utilize the same textures. I also only have one character to rig and even the robot has
                                    very little that will actually need to be rigged.

                                    <br>I had to change my original story plan as I was writing the script out. I realized that
                                    I was trying to do to much and would not be able to complete it within 1 minute. Anything
                                    over one minute would be cutting it to close to finishing within the semester, so I tried
                                    to think about what else I could do and tell the same story. I decided to only use one set
                                    and then have the ending take place from our view through the window on the set. I hope that
                                    it still seems playful at the end without the use of the outside world being fully built. I
                                    also decided to include some dialogue in the form of a radio announcer as I thought it was lacking
                                    something. This also gave me a better way to introduce the inital shock to the character and I think
                                    that it plays out better now.

                                I have been runing various test trying to figure out how to animated one color being taken over by another.
                                Using the two different textures with a mix node and then using a ramp to control the mix, plus applying noise,
                                keyframe the values of the ramp and show this swirl effect. I think this will be the best way to do simple color swaps
                                while rendering. I have also started looking into After Effects to see if I can just render the entire film in black and white
                                and then again in color. I could then use After Effects and masking to handle all the color swaps in post and also come up with
                                some neat tracking color swaps so that the robot can do more then just instant change the color of something. Just an idea right now.

                                <h3>Final Character Design and Shader</h3>
                                Designing out the robot was pretty simple. He is made of of very basic shapes and should be very easy to rig.
                                Two problem areas with this design are going to be how to animate the wheels going around when they are an
                                odd shape and the face design moving with the body. The face is unique because it is made from a MASH node,
                                MASH nodes are super useful but I am not sure how they work with animating. I have completed test in the past
                                for animating a face in MASH but never having the entire MASH network move along with a character. Finally, I
                                needed to work on the style for my film. I took inspiration from the latest Spiderman and decided on a Halftone
                                Toon Shader texture. This was not as easy as the modeling phase as I had to build the entire texture from scratch.
                                There is a built in Halftone texture in Maya but sadly will not work with Arnold and it also did not look as nice
                                as what I was able to achieve in the end. I tied everything together in the end with a color ramp that allowed me to
                                have the toon shader effect with different sized halftones depending on the color. I think this will work well for my film.

                                <h3>ACM 320 Animated Film Concept</h3>
                                As a huge fan of Love, Death, and Robots, I wanted to make an animated film about some sort of robot.
                                Taking inspiration from Wall-E, I thought of a dystopian world. I want it to be bland and without any color.
                                I then doodled out what my little bot would look like and started to imagin how he would feel in this world.
                                I then imagined him all of a sudden experiencing color for the first time and I decided that this could be 
                                the focus of my animated short. With a little help from my wife I talked through my story and we thought it
                                would be cute if he turns into color for the first time when he gets shocked one day. Because of this shock,
                                he wanted to bring color to the world and goes out on an adventure bringing turing the bland world into color.
                                I am still thinking of a good ending but am leaning towards the robot stumnbling across some form of junction box
                                and thinking that if he shocks it the whole city will be colorful. This of course ends poorly with everything being
                                shut off leaving the world a dark and colorless place. Just his eyes are seen glowing at the end.
