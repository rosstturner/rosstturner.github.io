                                    I finally finished my main character. I also was able to wrap up all of my assets including the back ground city scape
                                    that I was the most worried about. The city could still use some work but I think that it is okay to start animating and adding
                                    more detail to the textures. I have continued to run test renders to see how things are coming together and I have really liked
                                    the results so far. My script is finalized and I have completely filled out the pre-production package for class. From here on,
                                    I will be following the schedule that I layed out and I should be able to finsish with some time to spare. My package is estimating
                                    about 23 days of animation but I think that it will be much faster due to the fact that I have only a few different textures to create
                                    and the rigging is almost non-existant. I will be starting animations very soon and will post the test to here.

                                    I have been working on my character model again. I have been struggling with
                                    getting the right look for the main robot. I think that I am close to it with
                                    my current version, so I have decided to move on for now and maybe it will look
                                    more correct when I finish my initial scenes. I have started building out all the
                                    rest of my models. They do not have a lot of detail so making them should be fairly
                                    quick. I also fully filled out my pre-production document and have a good schedule to
                                    follow. My schedule is estimating 23 days of animations but I think that I will be able
                                    to speed up several areas of the pipeline because so many items are simply designed and
                                    utilize the same textures. I also only have one character to rig and even the robot has
                                    very little that will actually need to be rigged.

                                    <br>I had to change my original story plan as I was writing the script out. I realized that
                                    I was trying to do to much and would not be able to complete it within 1 minute. Anything
                                    over one minute would be cutting it to close to finishing within the semester, so I tried
                                    to think about what else I could do and tell the same story. I decided to only use one set
                                    and then have the ending take place from our view through the window on the set. I hope that
                                    it still seems playful at the end without the use of the outside world being fully built. I
                                    also decided to include some dialogue in the form of a radio announcer as I thought it was lacking
                                    something. This also gave me a better way to introduce the inital shock to the character and I think
                                    that it plays out better now.

                                I have been runing various test trying to figure out how to animated one color being taken over by another.
                                Using the two different textures with a mix node and then using a ramp to control the mix, plus applying noise,
                                keyframe the values of the ramp and show this swirl effect. I think this will be the best way to do simple color swaps
                                while rendering. I have also started looking into After Effects to see if I can just render the entire film in black and white
                                and then again in color. I could then use After Effects and masking to handle all the color swaps in post and also come up with
                                some neat tracking color swaps so that the robot can do more then just instant change the color of something. Just an idea right now.

                                <h3>Final Character Design and Shader</h3>
                                Designing out the robot was pretty simple. He is made of of very basic shapes and should be very easy to rig.
                                Two problem areas with this design are going to be how to animate the wheels going around when they are an
                                odd shape and the face design moving with the body. The face is unique because it is made from a MASH node,
                                MASH nodes are super useful but I am not sure how they work with animating. I have completed test in the past
                                for animating a face in MASH but never having the entire MASH network move along with a character. Finally, I
                                needed to work on the style for my film. I took inspiration from the latest Spiderman and decided on a Halftone
                                Toon Shader texture. This was not as easy as the modeling phase as I had to build the entire texture from scratch.
                                There is a built in Halftone texture in Maya but sadly will not work with Arnold and it also did not look as nice
                                as what I was able to achieve in the end. I tied everything together in the end with a color ramp that allowed me to
                                have the toon shader effect with different sized halftones depending on the color. I think this will work well for my film.

                                <h3>ACM 320 Animated Film Concept</h3>
                                As a huge fan of Love, Death, and Robots, I wanted to make an animated film about some sort of robot.
                                Taking inspiration from Wall-E, I thought of a dystopian world. I want it to be bland and without any color.
                                I then doodled out what my little bot would look like and started to imagin how he would feel in this world.
                                I then imagined him all of a sudden experiencing color for the first time and I decided that this could be 
                                the focus of my animated short. With a little help from my wife I talked through my story and we thought it
                                would be cute if he turns into color for the first time when he gets shocked one day. Because of this shock,
                                he wanted to bring color to the world and goes out on an adventure bringing turing the bland world into color.
                                I am still thinking of a good ending but am leaning towards the robot stumnbling across some form of junction box
                                and thinking that if he shocks it the whole city will be colorful. This of course ends poorly with everything being
                                shut off leaving the world a dark and colorless place. Just his eyes are seen glowing at the end.
